## MyShell
My first shell.

Main shell is found within `exercises/prompt.c`.

It's all written in one file, as it's purely experimental, an exercise in the creation of a shell before I begin the polished, finished product.

All other `.c` files inside `exercises/` are seperate exercises with system calls, helping me understand them before implementing them inside my shell.
