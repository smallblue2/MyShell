===== Notes for implementing proper shell =====

for CWD pointer;
avoid it, use getenv("PWD") instead.

In cd function;
check for absolute before relative, fixes behaviour of 'cd /' and avoids computing 'relpathname'.
for setting PWD with relative, be smart about '.' and '..', or else it'll keep adding and adding to infinitely long relpathname
