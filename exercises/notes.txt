===== Notes for implementing proper shell =====

for CWD pointer;
avoid it, use getenv("PWD") instead.

In cd function;
check for absolute before relative, fixes behaviour of 'cd /' and avoids computing 'relpathname'.
for setting PWD with relative, be smart about '.' and '..', or else it'll keep adding and adding to infinitely long relpathname
Do I need to check at all now?
does opendir do it for me?

For errors:
Better utilize errno.h, make an 'extern int errno'

For relativepaths:
make a helper function that gets relative paths of file names, or even finds if a path exists relative/absolute

For input/output redirection:
Combine both functions into one, as one can cut off the other by pointing characters to NULL before the other, cutting it off.
Call after isampersand, they're cutting off that too
